# Etch-a-Sketch

With this project I have focused on creating a clean and modern design.

The idea of hiding the different options in a side menu came to me when I was trying to decide where to position the buttons without polluting the general view.
With the lateral menu I have solved 2 different things:

  1- The overall design has gained amplitud and cleanliness.
  2- It was a good way to keep improving my coding skills.
  
I start to feel more comfortable setting up the different pieces of the website design.
